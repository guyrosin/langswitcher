# Language Switcher

Did you just write some text and then noticed you were using the wrong keyboard layout?

Instead of deleting that whole text, pressing `alt+shift` to switch to the right layout/language, and re-typing it in the that language...

This tiny utility lets you use a single hotkey (`ctrl+alt+shift`) to switch layout <b>and replace the recently typed text accordingly</b>.

The "recently typed text" resets in the following conditions:
1. X seconds passed from the last keystroke (configurable; default is 3).
2. The alt key was pressed.
